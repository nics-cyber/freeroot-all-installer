## Adding More Operating Systems

To add more operating systems, edit the `OS_LIST_JSON` variable in the script. Follow this format:

```json
{
  "id": 14,
  "name": "Slackware",
  "version": "15.0",
  "url": "http://mirrors.slackware.com/slackware/slackware-iso/slackware64-15.0-install-dvd.iso",
  "checksum": "sha256:slackware_checksum_here"
}
```

Add the new entry to the `operating_systems` array in the `OS_LIST_JSON` variable.
